Firstly, welcome to this blog. I am doing the challenge of #100-Days-Of-Programming
And just to get me accountable to something, I will write it here what I am learning. 

### Firstly what am I planning to learn ? 
1. Bash
2. Python
3. Javascript
4. MYSQL, NOSQL, Redis (Database)
5. GraphQL  

**I will be also creating projects and scripts to level up my skills. And at the end will try to make a project which will have everything above mentioned technologies. 



### Why am I learning it? 
Firstly, I am from InfoSec field. So I think knowing it gives me preety great understanding of how things  work under the hood. And also create payloads in order to test applications. Secondly it will save me my time, because I would be able to automate many tasks after this especially the ones which are quite repetative. I would be able to contribue to open source projects after this which I would love to <3 , because it will drastically enhance my skills. 


### Confession :
I have already learned programming earlier as well. So I have little knowledge before beginning this challenge. But at that time, I was just reading code from w3schools, tutspoint and was reading it , understanding it, and than wrote the same. And also watching courses thinking that I am making progress even though I didn't at all. Also, I would do this for 1-2 months and than got bored amidst and leave it for around 1-2 months. Than again I will come back and start from beginning :) . If you are doing the same, I recommend you to stop and start few projects, challenges as well. As they are crucial for any programmer's development in terms of what they have learned. 



Progress of each day :

**Day 1** - Learned about linux - its file structures, permissions, users, group, path, and its commands which are useful for daily usage.<br/>
